## Version numbers

The [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) standard means that each release has a [version number](https://semver.org/) such as `v1.4.2` where the three parts are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where

- `MAJOR` version when you make _incompatible_ API changes
- `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a _backward compatible_ manner
- `PATCH` version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
